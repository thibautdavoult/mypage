# Coolbloqs
game project, made during Ironhack bootcamp, week3.

## Rules

The game starts as a grid filled with tiles of different colors (randomized, up to ~5 colors max).

Player1 starts on top left corner. Player2 starts on bottom right corner. The game is turn based.

Player 1 moves first. Clicks on a tile adjacent to the one on the top left corner to "absorb" it.
Player 1's turn ends. Player 2's turn starts.
Player 2 also turns his tile into a bigger one by picking the color of an adjacent(s) tile(s).

Etc. Game keeps on until :
- Only one player is left.
- Both players have 1 color, biggest one wins.

## Must have features

- Randomized board creation
- Color switching & global mechanic (which tiles switch, which don't, etc)
- 2 players
- End of game
- Ending screen


## Nice to have features

- Changing size of the board
- Changing color scheme of tiles
- Colorblind mode
- Nightmode
- Animations (?, not sure if it'll actually improve the game)
