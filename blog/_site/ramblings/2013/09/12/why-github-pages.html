          <h2>Why Github Pages</h2>

<div class="post">
<h1>Quick intro: I don’t (usually) code</h1>

<p>I have never coded something. To me, Ruby, Python, Node, C, C++, Pascal are just names. I read about them, I have some diffuse ideas of concepts about these languages but it’s just what I heard actual developers say. I never actually got my hands dirty playing with any of them.</p>

<p>That changed yesterday when I decided it was time to start a blog built with something else than a ready-made platform: First I had started with Tumblr and a free theme, then Wordpress for Nitrogram which I didn’t have any part in setting up, then Medium to resurrect my personal blogging abilities, for which I only had to sign up to a mailing list.</p>

<h1>Why github pages?</h1>

<p>That is all to say I wanted to experience something more... advanced. Advanced <em>to me</em>, at least. What really got me started was the pretty convincing <a href="https://medium.com/writers-on-writing/c7cc156bc5d9" target="_blank">Why I Don&#39;t Write for Medium</a> by Joe Wegner, which garnered quite a bit of attention.
What truly resonated wasn’t really the IP problems stated (although these are probably valid points to avoid Medium, I don’t really care about what becomes of my writing so far, I’m no pro, and I’m not going to freak out if my content gets “stolen” (unlike <a href="http://revdancatt.com/2013/09/10/10-good-reason-buzzfeed-is-going-to-pay-my-fucking-invoice-for-copyright-theft/" target="_blank">that guy</a>).
No, what made me want to try setting up my own blog on Github Pages is this:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Learning Git</strong> as this is what my coworkers use to code Nitrogram</li>
<li><strong>Learning to code</strong> a little more. I have some basic HTML/CSS knowledge but I want to improve until I can consider myself dangerous</li>
<li><strong>Managing my blog structure the way I want</strong></li>
<li><strong>Creating a cooler “about me” page</strong> AKA some kind of online resume AKA just a page with clean text over clean images in the background.</li>
<li><strong>Github Pages are free too</strong></li>
<li><strong>It sounded easy as hell</strong> (It’s not but I figured it afterwards and the whole set up thing is pretty exciting anyway)</li>
</ol>

<p>That’s why 3 days ago I opened Terminal with a purpose for the first time.</p>

<h1>Github Pages + Jekyll = Very easy for a developer, not so much for me</h1>
